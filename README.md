# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions in Python

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) — a yearly set of challenging programming puzzles that take place every December.  
Each puzzle is designed to improve problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and coding fluency.

This repository contains my personal attempts, written in **Python 3**.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder represents a specific year (e.g. `2023`, `2024`...),  
and inside each year, each day’s puzzle is stored as a separate file or folder.

Example:
```
/2024
    day1-part1.py
    day1-part2.py
    day2-part1.py
    ...
/2025
    day1/
        input.txt
        solution.py
```

## 🐍 Language & Tools

- Python 3.x  
- Standard libraries only (unless noted otherwise)  
- No external dependencies required

## 🚀 Running the Code

Navigate to the specific folder and run the file:

```bash
python day01.py
```

In some cases, the script reads from an `input.txt` file, so make sure it's in the same directory.

## 🎯 Why I’m Doing This

- To sharpen my problem-solving and Python skills  
- For fun and learning  
- Possibly to cry over Day 24 puzzles...

## 📌 Notes

- I'm not aiming to write the most optimal or shortest solutions  
- Sometimes I add comments explaining my thought process  
- Inputs are not included for copyright reasons
